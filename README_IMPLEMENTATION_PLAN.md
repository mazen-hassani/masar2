## üìù HOW TO USE THE PROMPTS

### For Code Generation LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)

Each chunk in IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPTS.md is formatted as a ready-to-use prompt:

```
# How to use:
1. Open IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPTS.md
2. Find your current chunk (e.g., "CHUNK 4.2: Program CRUD Endpoints")
3. Copy the entire prompt section
4. Paste into Claude/GPT interface
5. AI generates code
6. Review generated code
7. Test against acceptance criteria
8. Integrate into your codebase
```

### Example Usage

**Prompt** (from CHUNK 4.2):
```
# PROMPT 4.2: Program & Project CRUD Endpoints

## CONTEXT
From PHASE 1: Foundation complete with tenants, users, roles, auth, middleware.
You're now implementing API endpoints for CRUD operations on Programs and Projects.

## OBJECTIVE
Create POST/GET/PUT/DELETE endpoints for programs and projects...

## REQUIREMENTS
- Endpoints: POST /api/programs, GET /api/programs, etc.
- Use tenant context from middleware (filter by tenantId)
- Validate requests with Zod
- Return paginated results
- Include related entities
- Check user permissions
- Consistent error responses

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
1. ‚úÖ POST /api/programs creates new program
2. ‚úÖ GET /api/programs lists with pagination
... (10+ criteria)
```

**How to use**:
```bash
# 1. Copy the prompt
# 2. Paste into Claude: "Generate code for this task:"
# 3. Claude generates comprehensive implementation
# 4. You review and integrate
# 5. Run tests to verify
```

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Paste the full prompt** - Include all sections (context, requirements, criteria)
2. **Ask for tests first** - "First write the tests, then implement"
3. **Review the code** - Check quality, patterns match project
4. **Test thoroughly** - Run all tests before committing
5. **Ask for refactoring** - If something looks wrong: "This pattern violates X, refactor"

---

## ‚úÖ ACCEPTANCE & SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Per Chunk
Each chunk specifies 5-10 acceptance criteria that must be met:
- ‚úÖ Code compiles/runs
- ‚úÖ Tests pass
- ‚úÖ Integrates with previous chunks
- ‚úÖ Meets performance requirements
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript/ESLint errors

### Per Phase
After completing all chunks in a phase:
- ‚úÖ All dependencies from previous phases work
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes
- ‚úÖ Ready for next phase

### Pre-Production (Phase 8)
- ‚úÖ 80%+ test coverage
- ‚úÖ All E2E tests passing
- ‚úÖ Performance tests passed (p95 < 2s)
- ‚úÖ Security review completed
- ‚úÖ Ready to deploy

---

## üõ°Ô∏è RISK MITIGATION

### Orphaned Code Risk
**How it's prevented**: Every chunk explicitly states what depends on it. Code is tested immediately or used in next chunk.

### Scope Creep Risk
**How it's prevented**: Each chunk is 1-3 hours of work. Acceptance criteria are specific and testable. No "nice-to-haves."

### Multi-Tenant Data Leakage
**How it's prevented**: Middleware enforces tenant context. Every query filters by tenantId. Tests verify cross-tenant access fails.

### Permission Bypass
**How it's prevented**: Phase 2 Chunk 2.6 implements role checking. Every API endpoint verifies permissions. Audit logging tracks access.

### Dependency Hell
**How it's prevented**: Dependencies clearly documented. Each chunk lists what it needs. No circular dependencies.

## üìö REFERENCE DOCUMENTS

| Document | Purpose | Who Should Read | Time |
|----------|---------|-----------------|------|
| **spec.md** | Complete requirements | Everyone (at least once) | 1-2 hours |
| **ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md** | System design & dependencies | Tech leads, architects | 1-2 hours |
| **IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPTS.md** | Chunk prompts for code generation | Developers (as needed) | Per chunk |
| **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** | Patterns, setup, debugging | Developers (always open) | 30 min + reference |
| **README_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** | This file - overview & timeline | Everyone | 20-30 min |

---

## üéØ KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Strict Ordering**: Follow chunks in sequence. Dependencies are real.
2. **Test-Driven**: Write tests first, implement to pass them.
3. **No Orphaned Code**: Every piece integrates immediately.
4. **Right-Sized Chunks**: 2-3 hours each, testable, valuable.
5. **Clear Documentation**: Every chunk has acceptance criteria.
6. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (middleware, service, database).
7. **Measurable Progress**: Each chunk is a complete, shippable unit.

---

## üö® CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

**Do These**:
- ‚úÖ Read the architecture document before starting
- ‚úÖ Complete chunks in order
- ‚úÖ Write tests for each chunk
- ‚úÖ Verify acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Review generated code before committing
- ‚úÖ Check TypeScript/ESLint before moving on
- ‚úÖ Test multi-tenancy isolation
- ‚úÖ Verify permissions enforcement

**Don't Do These**:
- ‚ùå Skip Phase 1 (you'll regret it)
- ‚ùå Start Phase 3 before Phase 2 is complete
- ‚ùå Implement without tests
- ‚ùå Ignore acceptance criteria
- ‚ùå Skip error handling
- ‚ùå Forget tenant filtering
- ‚ùå Merge without tests passing
- ‚ùå Leave console.log statements in production code

---

## üìû SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I don't understand the architecture"
‚Üí Read ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md sections 1-4 slowly, draw diagrams

### "Chunk depends on something not done"
‚Üí Check dependency graph in chunk, do dependencies first

### "Tests are failing"
‚Üí Read DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md "Testing Checklist" section

### "TypeScript errors everywhere"
‚Üí Run `npm run type-check`, read error messages carefully

### "Multi-tenancy seems broken"
‚Üí Check DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md "Common Patterns" section

### "Code generation isn't working"
‚Üí Make sure you include full prompt context, ask for tests first
