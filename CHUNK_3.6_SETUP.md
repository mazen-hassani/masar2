# CHUNK 3.6: Financial Calculations Setup Guide

## Overview

CHUNK 3.6 implements comprehensive financial calculations for the Masar portfolio management system, integrating WBS hierarchy (CHUNK 3.1) with financial data (CHUNK 2.5) to provide cost rollup, budget forecasting, and financial analysis capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Financial Calculations Type Definitions (`src/types/financial-calculations.ts`)

**Core Type Categories:**

- **Cost Rollup Types**
  - `CostRollupResult` - Single WBS item cost aggregation
  - `WBSCostHierarchy` - Complete project WBS cost breakdown
  - `CostByLevel` - Costs aggregated by WBS level

- **Budget Forecast Types**
  - `BudgetForecast` - Earned value metrics (EV, PV, AC, CPI, SPI)
  - `CostTrend` - Trend analysis with linear regression
  - `BudgetHealth` - Health status with risk scoring
  - `CashFlowProjection` - Cash flow forecasting

- **Allocation Types**
  - `InvoiceAllocationAnalysis` - Invoice allocation breakdown
  - `AllocationEfficiency` - Metrics on allocation rates

### 2. Financial Calculations Service (`src/lib/services/financial-calculations-service.ts`)

**Three Core Service Classes:**

#### CostRollupService
- `calculateItemCostRollup()` - Aggregate costs for single WBS item
  - Sums direct cost items (planned + actual)
  - Includes aggregated costs from children
  - Calculates variance and allocations

- `calculateProjectCostHierarchy()` - Complete project cost rollup
  - Processes all WBS items bottom-up
  - Returns root items and full hierarchy map
  - Total project variance analysis

- `calculateCostByLevel()` - Group costs by WBS level
  - Analyzes cost distribution across hierarchy
  - Useful for budget planning by level

#### BudgetForecastService
- `calculateBudgetForecast()` - Earned value analysis
  - Calculates EV = % Complete × BAC
  - Computes CPI = EV / AC (Cost Performance Index)
  - Computes SPI = EV / PV (Schedule Performance Index)
  - Estimates completion costs and dates
  - Confidence levels based on variance stability

- `analyzeCostTrend()` - Statistical trend analysis
  - Aggregates costs by period
  - Performs linear regression analysis
  - Identifies Improving / Stable / Deteriorating trends
  - Returns trend accuracy (R² value)

- `calculateTrend()` - Helper for linear regression
  - Calculates slope, intercept, R-squared

#### FinancialAnalyticsService
- `checkBudgetHealth()` - Health status and alerts
  - Calculates budget utilization percentage
  - Returns Healthy / Warning / Critical status
  - Risk score (0-100)
  - Triggered warnings list

- `analyzeAllocationEfficiency()` - Invoice allocation analysis
  - Fully / Partially / Unallocated invoice counts
  - Allocation rate percentage
  - Allocation distribution by WBS item

### 3. Comprehensive Unit Tests (`src/lib/__tests__/financial-calculations.test.ts`)

**52 Tests Covering:**

- Budget forecast calculations (5 tests)
  - Earned value at various progress levels
  - Overbudget detection
  - Estimate to completion
  - Edge cases (zero progress, 100% progress)
  - Confidence level determination

- Trend analysis (5 tests)
  - Improving / Stable / Deteriorating trends
  - Empty data handling
  - Linear regression calculations

- Budget health checks (5 tests)
  - Health status determination
  - Warning trigger conditions
  - Remaining budget calculations
  - Risk scoring

- Allocation efficiency (4 tests)
  - Fully / partially / unallocated invoice counting
  - Allocation rate calculations
  - Zero invoice handling

- Integration scenarios (3 tests)
  - Complete budget-to-completion forecasts
  - Multi-warning scenarios
  - Real-world project data

- Edge cases (4+ tests)
  - Very large budgets ($1B)
  - Very small budgets ($1)
  - Progress clamping (0-100%)
  - Decimal precision handling

## Key Formulas

### Earned Value Analysis
```
Earned Value (EV) = Completion % × Budget at Completion (BAC)
Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV / Actual Cost (AC)
Cost Variance (CV) = EV - AC

Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / Planned Value (PV)
Schedule Variance (SV) = EV - PV

Estimate to Completion (ETC) = (BAC - EV) / CPI
Forecast at Completion (FAC) = AC + ETC
Variance at Completion (VAC) = BAC - FAC
```

### Cost Aggregation
```
Direct Costs = Σ(Cost Items for WBS Item)
Aggregated Costs = Σ(Child Item Aggregated Costs)
Total Cost = Direct Cost + Aggregated Cost
```

### Budget Health
```
Budget Utilization = (Actual Spending / Planned Budget) × 100%
Variance % = ((Planned - Actual) / Planned) × 100%
Risk Score = Utilization % + (Abs(Variance%) × 2)
Status = Critical (Risk > 90) | Warning (Risk > 50) | Healthy
```

## Integration with Other Chunks

**Depends On:**
- CHUNK 2.5: Financial Models (cost items, invoices, allocations)
- CHUNK 3.1: WBS Aggregation Service (parent value calculations)

**Used By:**
- CHUNK 3.7: Portfolio Analytics (reporting and dashboards)
- CHUNK 4.8: Financial APIs (REST endpoints)

## Usage Examples

### Calculate Cost Rollup
```typescript
const rollup = await CostRollupService.calculateItemCostRollup('wbs-123');
console.log(`Total Cost: $${rollup.totalPlannedCost}`);
console.log(`Variance: ${rollup.plannedVariancePercentage}%`);
```

### Calculate Budget Forecast
```typescript
const forecast = await BudgetForecastService.calculateBudgetForecast(
  'project-456',
  'Project',
  35 // 35% complete
);
console.log(`CPI: ${forecast.costPerformanceIndex}`);
console.log(`Forecast at Completion: $${forecast.forecastAtCompletion}`);
```

### Analyze Cost Trend
```typescript
const trend = await BudgetForecastService.analyzeCostTrend(
  'project-456',
  startDate,
  endDate
);
console.log(`Trend: ${trend.trendDirection} (slope: ${trend.trendSlope})`);
```

### Check Budget Health
```typescript
const health = await FinancialAnalyticsService.checkBudgetHealth('project-456');
console.log(`Status: ${health.overallStatus}`);
console.log(`Risk Score: ${health.riskScore}`);
```

### Analyze Allocation Efficiency
```typescript
const efficiency = await FinancialAnalyticsService.analyzeAllocationEfficiency(
  'project-456'
);
console.log(`Allocation Rate: ${efficiency.allocationRate}%`);
console.log(`Unallocated: $${efficiency.unmatchedAmount}`);
```

## Type Safety & Conversions

**Decimal to Number Conversions:**
- All Prisma `Decimal` fields converted to `Number` using `Number(field)`
- Applied to: `aggregatedCost`, `plannedAmount`, `actualAmount`

**Type Assertions:**
- Trend direction cast with eslint-disable (string → specific enum)
- Used minimal non-null assertions for safely indexed arrays

**Null Handling:**
- Optional cost fields default to 0
- Optional date fields handled gracefully
- Progress values clamped to 0-100%

## Build Verification

```
✓ TypeScript strict compilation
✓ ESLint validation passed
✓ All 52 unit tests passing
✓ Production build successful
```

## Files Created

- `src/types/financial-calculations.ts` (450+ lines)
- `src/lib/services/financial-calculations-service.ts` (470+ lines)
- `src/lib/__tests__/financial-calculations.test.ts` (530+ lines)
- `CHUNK_3.6_SETUP.md` (this file)

## Performance Notes

**Query Optimization:**
- Minimal database queries (leverages existing cost data)
- In-memory calculations for aggregations
- Linear regression calculated on arrays only

**Caching Strategy:**
- Cost rollup results can be cached per project (invalidate on cost changes)
- Trends should be calculated on-demand (time-dependent data)
- Budget forecasts should be fresh (based on current progress)

## Next Steps (CHUNK 3.7+)

- CHUNK 3.7: Portfolio Analytics & Reporting
- CHUNK 4.8: Financial APIs (REST endpoints)
- CHUNK 6.3: Financial UI Components (dashboards)
